Piers Morgan then insists on hearing exactly what he saw. WARNING: While his recounting doesn't include visuals, it is extremely graphic and heart wrenching.  Civilization vs. Barbarism. <!--1716565606844277129-->

Several of those prosecutors withdrew from the case over "professional and ethical" objections.   When told there was no valid case against the officers, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman screamed that his prosecutors were "f*cking this up." Freeman blamed them for ruining his chance at political stardom and later retaliated against the prosecutors.  Then, the Minnesota attorney general — radical Marxist Keith Ellison — stepped in to charge the officers. The case against J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Kiernan Lane, and Tou Thao was political from the beginning, brought to appease a shrieking criminal mob rather than to achieve justice. All three of them should be released immediately.  Not only that, but Hennepin County's medical examiner said there "were no medical indications of asphyxia or strangulation" — in other words, Chauvin's knee did nothing to kill George Floyd.  From the beginning, everything you were told in 2020 was a lie.  https://alphanews.org/court-docs-reveal-extreme-public-pressure-on-prosecutors-in-george-floyd-case/ <!--1715490405750538695-->

Instead the swamp knifes them all in the back.  Pretty unbelievable how devoted the Republican establishment is to bombing foreign countries, keeping our border open, and spending us into oblivion.

Now, it's increasingly clear that   1) It was a rocket, not a bomb  2) It was fired from Gaza, not Israel and not from a jet  3) The actual hospital is still standing, and  4) There is no proof of a massive 500-person death toll  When you make your rockets out of pillaged EU-funded water pipes, don't be surprised when some of them drop out of the sky and blow up your own people.  The question is, why did so much of the world immediate take HAMAS's word for it? <!--1714670811485983026-->

After Trudeau admits how "deeply embarrassing" it was for the Canadian Parliament to give a standing ovation to an actual Nazi, he quickly pivots to SocalistGPT talking points and blames RUSSIAN propaganda:  "It's going to be really important that all of us push back against Russian propaganda, Russian disinformation, and continue our steadfast and unequivocal support for Ukraine.”  Russia, Russia, Russia!

Transgender military spokesman for Ukraine who now goes by Sarah Ashton-Cirillo, was just honored by Las Vegas city hall. He was also given certificates of recognition by US Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Rep. Dina Titus, and former Nevada Gov Steve Sisolak. Oh, and the Smithsonian Institute wants one of Sarah Ashton's military uniforms!  Sarah Ashton-Cirillo recently issued threats in English targeting westerners that Ukraine will "hunt down" and "bring justice" to all those deemed anti-Ukraine propagandists.

Criminals will run wild and cops will have no tools to stop them. Retailers are already fleeing Chicago because rampant theft makes it impossible to turn a profit. Rather than fix that problem and side with those who follow the law, Chicago is plotting to open a government-run grocery store.

Remember: The open border lobby’s big prize is Texas. They’re willing to flood America with 10,000,000 illegal criminals so long as the majority stay in Texas and eventually turn it blue.  Democrats have never believed in open borders for their communities. They just believe in open borders FOR YOU. <!--1700252725681025096-->

That's right, if you are a parent in California that has traditional values or simply believes boys are boys and girls are girls, you might lose custody of your kids.  The bill already passed the California Senate and will now head to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law.  California is the Democrat model for the rest of America: One-party rule, extreme wealth stratification, millions of illegals, mass exodus of the middle-class, crime, open air drug use, high taxes, and all it marked by a woke assault on science, biology, and God-ordained parental rights. <!--1700228536156696733-->

Now he wants nothing to do with the Biden regime's plan to move 60,000 illegals from New York City to the Atlantic City airport:  “I don't see any scenario where we're going to be able to take in a program in Atlantic City or frankly elsewhere in the state."  “We are already seeing folks in New Jersey that have probably swelled into Jersey from New York City or from other locations, but you need scale, enormous amount of federal support—resources that go beyond anything that we can afford—putting everything else aside.”  Everything the left inherits it ruins. Everything it takes over it destroys. <!--1699204768856727915-->

Why?  NFRW's national president, Eileen Sobjack, reportedly fears a costly lawsuit and told state leaders that “addressing this issue would end us. I will not let this issue be our demise.”  If even Republican women can’t answer the question, “What is a woman?” then we are truly lost.  When you wonder why Republicans you send to Washington turn out to be complete cowards and turncoats, remember this story.  https://wnd.com/2023/09/major-gop-womens-group-opens-door-biological-men-joining/ <!--1699114034346483723-->

The Berlin Wall was built by communists to keep people in—from escaping East Germany for the free West.   The existing US border wall is to keep people out— an invasion, drug traffickers, and cartels.   By the end of Joe Biden’s 4-year term, 10,000,000 illegals will break into the US and nearly 400,000 Americans will have died from drugs trafficked over the Mexico border.   Since June, Caballero has lived in a high security facility after US intelligence alerted her to credible threats of assassination from the same criminal elements the wall helps keep from terrorizing San Diego.Translate post <!--1698716804309455158-->

They're arguing, in effect, that he is guilty until proven innocent, and they claim that any government official is empowered to pass this judgment on him.  The obvious purpose of this is a backup plan. Even if all of Jack Smith and Fani Willis's rigged charges fail, their plan is to get swing-state radicals like Adrian Fontes in Arizona or Jocelyn Benson in Michigan to unilaterally kick Trump off the ballot in order to make the 2024 election unwinnable.  Nobody is a bigger enemy of democratic elections or our Constitution than elite Democrats. <!--1693649440547189059-->

After all, many Republicans demanded a special counsel for this exact case.  But it’s a lie and a deception. It also probably the most obvious misstep to date of the Biden "Justice" Department.   Weiss was architect of the phony, sweetheart plea deal for Hunter.   Weiss' staff included a longtime Biden associate during his investigation.   Weiss also deliberately let the statute of limitations lapse so that some of Hunter’s most flagrant crimes couldn’t be prosecuted.  Weiss’s appointment is also illegal.   Section 600.3 of the Code of Federal Regulations states specifically that “[a] Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States Government.” That’s because the entire point of a special counsel is to be outside the influence and control of the DOJ apparatus.  Weiss isn’t “outside the federal government” at all though. He's a company man. He's a federal employee controlled by Merrick Garland and Joe Biden.   But Weiss’s appointment reveals the Regime's desperation.   House Oversight's investigation was getting too hot. They were too close to the truth. Weiss' purpose is to keep Hunter Biden and the Big Guy as far away from accountability as possible, for as long as possible.   House Republicans should now feel 100% emboldened to impeach Garland, defund him, or stop him however they can.  The gloves should now, finally, be all the way off. <!--1691985955954237928-->

Obviously, nobody thinks Joe Biden is fully in charge of his own White House. The real question is, who is? It ain't Kamala. There are more and more whispers that the man at the heart of things may in fact still be President Obama — who, unlike any other former U.S. presidents for the past century, still maintains a primary residence in D.C. Roughly 75 percent of top Biden aids are Obama-era veterans.  Now, one of Britain's top papers says that foreign politicians assume Biden won't be the 2024 nominee, and when they talk to him they feel like they're just talking to the face of the operation, not its brain. Whoever that brain is, they clearly don't want Kamala as president, and they probably don't want Gavin Newsom either.  Michelle, in contrast, polls well, and can replace Kamala without anyone calling it racist. Watch for Democrats to start quietly pushing Michelle Obama more and more, as a "unifying force" for the party against Trump.  Is Michelle remotely qualified or capable of being president? The answer to that for Democrats is "who cares?" For them, Biden is the ultimate proof of concept they can get the world to accept any warm (or cold) body as "President of the United Sates." <!--1690469049048977408-->

Majorie Taylor Greene, has confirmed that the "unnamed" foreign national who allegedly bribed Joe and Hunter Biden with $10 million, was none other than Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky.   The now infamous FBI FD-1023 form provide by Wray had redacted Zlochevsky's name but detailed a $10 million bribe to the Bidens with someone connected to Burisma.   Putting it all together...  We know that Zlochesvsky was already paying Hunter an exorbitant sum, $83,000/mo, to sit on the board of his Ukrainian energy company.  We know Zlochevsky was facing a corruption investigation in Ukraine by prosecutor Viktor Shokin.   We know then-Vice President Joe Biden accused Shokin of corruption.  We know that then-VP Biden successfully threatened to pull a $1 billion US loan guarantee as leverage to push for Shokin’s removal.   We know Shokin was replaced by Yuriy Lutsenko, who cleared Zlochevsky and Burisma of criminal charges in 2019.  We know that Zlochevsky and his associates were eventually charged in 2020 for attempting $6 million in bribes to halt the ongoing investigation (the guy has a history of bribes).   And we know that Zlochevsky was a rich, corrupt foreign oligarch who needed the type of help only connected, corrupt DC cronyism could deliver.  And it all points to one conclusion: Joe and James and Hunter  were willing to sell out American interests to keep the Ukrainian money flowing.

Luft was recently arrested and is currently a fugitive, which he claims was to stop him from testifying before House Oversight. We don't know if his allegations are true, but there's reason to believe him: Luft showed proof his attorney spoke to the FBI all the way back in fall 2020, days after the Hunter laptop released.  Luft says he offered evidence against the Bidens during a meeting with the FBI in Brussels in 2019. He's named multiple specific names of the people he met. verifying whether that meeting happened should be easy.  If Luft is telling the truth about that meeting, then he very likely is telling the truth about two other facts: That the Bidens provided an FBI mole named "One Eye" to funnel intel to the CEFC, and that Hunter and James Bides were being paid $165,000/month, combined, to lobby for a Chinese energy company with direct and well-known ties to the CCP.  These are spectacular allegations. But why would that make them untrue?   The Hunter Biden laptop was spectacular, but it's true.  The idea that Hunter Biden could become a painter, and immediately start selling his "art" for 6 figures, is insane, but true.   It's ridiculous to believe that unqualified Hunter Biden was paid $83,000 a month by a Ukrainian energy firm while his father was head of Ukraine policy for the Obama WH, but it's true.   It's ridiculous to believe that multiple IRS agents stepped forward with damning proof that the DOJ engaged in an elaborate scheme to shield Hunter Biden from more serious crimes.   But it's all TRUE.  The regime's strategy for the Biden family corruption is to beat you down with deafening silence from Joe Biden, from the legacy media, and from our law enforcement agencies in response to the most glaring corruption imaginable.   All while they work to throw Donald Trump in prison for 200 years for a paperwork dispute.  Your job is to not fall for it.Tradueix el tuit <!--1676960136542445571-->

Maybe he was limited by DOJ brass from expanding his investigation to cover $10 million in alleged international bribery payments. Maybe he was intentionally aiding and abetting the coverup himself. But the DOJ knew these tax and gun charges were a non-issue. And if that's all there was, they wouldn't have needed five years to wrap this up. But now they get to say, "See, Hunter has been held accountable for his crimes when he was an addict, let's move on."  This is designed to give the DOJ a veneer of impartiality before it tries its case against Trump. It's an orchestrated PR campaign.  What comes next is Jack Smith will leverage the seditious conspiracy convictions the DOJ has obtained against J6 defendants, alongside the alternate electors from contested states, to bring INSURRECTION charges against Trump. This will likely be via Smith's grand jury in DC.  NYC/Stormy Daniels and Miami/Espionage indictments exist to shift the Overton Window. It's now normalized to indict a former president and current presidential candidate.  This has only three possible endings:  1) Trump gets convicted of abetting insurrection, becomes ineligible for the presidency, and goes to prison for the rest of his life.  2) Trump is able to delay the cases against him long enough that he can run and win in 2024, in which case he pardons himself.  3) Trump loses in 2024, gets convicted, and spends the rest of his life in prison.  All this over a document dispute with Biden's NARA librarians and a supposed "coup" where no one brought any weapons and the insurrectionists "occupied" the Capitol to take selfies.  This is the plan. <!--1671231229587521536-->

Zuckerberg admitted Facebook and Instagram also suppressed the story after being contacted by the FBI.  These 51 former intelligence officials all still had their security clearances.  Most if not all of them knew this was a dirty political trick done in direct coordination with the Biden Campaign to interfere with the 2020 Presidential Election and stop Trump. <!--1654271916373610497-->

Conservatives rightly wonder why Biden, a man with so little organic fanfare, has been propped up by the Democrat machine. It's because he is the perfect empty vessel to be captured by this scientific, technological elite Eisenhower warned of. For decades, people feared the rise of an Anti-Christ, a Hitlerian figure who would tyrannize the American republic. This was what the left said about Trump. But ultimately, the administrative state fought back and succeeded in removing him. That same power hand-selected Joe Biden and will do whatever it can to entrench him in the White House, because he's their perfect pawn.  Eisenhower didn't predict a singular, charismatic tyrant. He predicted instead a tyrannical, faceless elite. And we are living in that nightmare.翻譯推文 <!--1651275292730880000-->

Last night at SFSU, TPUSA hosted a Saving Women’s Sports event with star swimmer @Riley_Gaines_ when radical Trans activists physically assaulted her and then barricaded her in a safe room for hours.  On Tuesday night, another TPUSA event at the University of Albany featuring pro-life speaker @ighaworth was interrupted by Anti-Christian, far-left students who proceeded to destroy a Bible.   And last Thursday, far-left students hijacking a pro-life event at Virginia Commonwealth University featuring TPUSA speaker @theisabelb and Students for Life's @KristanHawkins, as protesters threw punches and injured a chapter president.   All of this comes just weeks after a violent Antifa mob assaulted cops and shattered glass attempting to break into my event at UC Davis.   When every campus conservative speaker is labeled a Nazi, a fascist, a racist, or as somehow wanting a "trans genocide" by radical student groups and their allies in the mainstream media and administrations, these domestic extremists feel free to assault and terrorize.   Enough is enough.   There must be real legal, educational, and career consequences for these criminals, and conservative states must lead the way.   I will personally make myself available to any lawmakers who want advice on how best to proceed.ツイートを翻訳 <!--1644389858985783297-->
